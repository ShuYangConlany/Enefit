To run the code you need to downoad the dataset from Kaggle, a competition whose link being:
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-energy-behavior-of-prosumers/overview

My way of importing the data set is to read from google drive, you can download it in working space.

In colab, to use the catBoost regressor you need to fill the NaN with some number but you don't need 
to do that on Kaggle notebook

Results:
MSE:24
running time(GPU): 4 min
